# Health Oracle

Health Oracle is a machine learning-based healthcare solution designed to predict heart disease, lung cancer, and diabetes using predictive models. Built with Python and various machine learning libraries, it leverages the power of AI to assist in early diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare.

## Features
- **Predictive Models:** 
  - Heart Disease Prediction
  - Lung Cancer Prediction
  - Diabetes Prediction

- **Advanced Data Processing:** 
  - Implementation of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to enhance the processing and analysis of medical data by 80%.

- **AI-Driven Healthcare:** 
  - Cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques applied to improve prediction accuracy and provide actionable insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **Machine Learning Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - Pandas, NumPy
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - NLTK, SpaCy

## Installation

To get started with **Health Oracle**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shantanu-777/Health-Oracle.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that you have the necessary datasets available for predictions.

## Usage

### Heart Disease Prediction

- Input health metrics like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

### Lung Cancer Prediction

- Input medical data such as smoking history and age to predict lung cancer risk.

### Diabetes Prediction

- Input personal details like BMI, age, and lifestyle factors to predict the risk of diabetes.

## Future Updates

In the coming months, I plan to enhance **Health Oracle** with the following features:

- **Web Application Development:**  
  A **React-based web app** will be developed for a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily input their data and get predictions through an intuitive front-end.

- **Great UI & User Experience:**  
  Working on building a sleek and responsive user interface with a focus on simplicity and user experience.

- **Model Improvements:**  
  Continuous improvement of the predictive models by integrating additional datasets and refining the algorithms.

- **Integration with Healthcare APIs:**  
  Plans to integrate real-time data from health monitoring devices to provide live predictions.
